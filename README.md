## Detailed Overview of Lift & Shift Web App on AWS Cloud

### Resources created in this project:
1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Definition: VPC allows you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined.
Usage: The web application was deployed within a VPC to ensure network isolation and security.
Components: Subnets (public and private), Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Route Tables, and Network ACLs were configured to control traffic flow and enhance security.
2. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Definition: IAM provides secure control of access to AWS services and resources.
Usage: IAM roles and policies were created to define permissions for different users and services. Roles were assigned to AWS services like EC2, RDS, and Beanstalk to manage resources securely.
Components: IAM Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies were used to manage permissions and ensure least privilege access.
3. Elastic Beanstalk
Definition: Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services.
Usage: Elastic Beanstalk was used to deploy the web application, handling the deployment details such as capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling.
Components: Environments, Applications, and Application Versions were managed in Beanstalk, with configuration for health monitoring and updates.
4. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
Definition: ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances.
Usage: An ELB was used to ensure high availability and fault tolerance by distributing incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances within the VPC.
Components: Application Load Balancer (ALB) was configured with target groups and listeners to manage HTTP/HTTPS traffic effectively.
5. Relational Database Service (RDS)
Definition: RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
Usage: RDS was used to host the web application's database, ensuring high availability, automated backups, and seamless scaling.
Components: Multi-AZ deployment for high availability, automated backups, and read replicas for improved performance.
6. Amazon MQ
Definition: Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers.
Usage: Amazon MQ was used to handle messaging between different components of the web application, ensuring reliable and asynchronous communication.
Components: Brokers and Queues were configured to manage message flow and ensure durability.
7. ElastiCache
Definition: ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud.
Usage: ElastiCache was used to improve application performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing latency, and offloading read traffic from the database.
Components: Redis or Memcached clusters were set up, with replication and automatic failover for high availability.


### Project Architecture:
##### Deploying a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with default parameters builds the following environment on the AWS Cloud.

### Implementation:

##### 1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Setup

1.1. Create a VPC
- Define a CIDR block, e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`.

1.2. Create Subnets
- Create public and private subnets in multiple availability zones for high availability.

1.3. Configure Route Tables
- Public subnet route table: Add a route to the Internet Gateway.
- Private subnet route table: Add a route to the NAT Gateway for outbound traffic.

1.4. Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
- Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC.
- Create and attach a NAT Gateway to the public subnet.

1.5. Security Groups
- Define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for your instances.


##### 2. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Setup

2.1. Create IAM Roles
- Define roles for EC2 instances to access AWS services like S3, RDS, etc.

2.2. Attach Policies
- Attach appropriate policies to IAM roles (e.g., AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess, AmazonRDSFullAccess).


##### 3. EC2 Instances with Tomcat Server

3.1. Launch EC2 Instances
- Launch instances in the public subnet for the web application and private subnet for backend services.

3.2. Install and Configure Tomcat
- Install Tomcat on EC2 instances:

```sh
sudo yum install tomcat -y
sudo systemctl start tomcat
sudo systemctl enable tomcat
Deploy your web application to the Tomcat server
```


##### 4. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

4.1. Create an ALB
- Define listeners for HTTP and HTTPS.
- Configure target groups to include the EC2 instances running the Tomcat server.

4.2. Configure Health Checks
- Set up health checks for the target groups to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.


##### 5. Amazon RDS for Database

5.1. Launch Amazon RDS Instance
- Choose the appropriate database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Configure the instance details and connect it to the private subnet.

5.2. Security Groups
- Ensure the RDS security group allows traffic from the EC2 instancesâ€™ security group.


##### 6. RabbitMQ Setup

6.1. Deploy RabbitMQ on EC2
- Launch an EC2 instance in the private subnet and Install RabbitMQ:

```sh
sudo yum install rabbitmq-server -y
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
```

6.2. Configure Security Groups
- Allow traffic on the default RabbitMQ port (5672) from the relevant security groups.


##### 7. Memcached Setup

7.1. Deploy Memcached on EC2
- Launch an EC2 instance in the private subnet and Install Memcached:

```sh
sudo yum install memcached -y
sudo systemctl start memcached
sudo systemctl enable memcached
```

7.2. Configure Security Groups
- Allow traffic on the default Memcached port (11211) from the relevant security groups.


##### 8. DNS Zone & Route 53 DNS Private Zone

8.1. Create Route 53 Hosted Zone
- Create a private hosted zone associated with your VPC.

8.2. Configure DNS Records
- Add A and CNAME records to route traffic to the ALB and internal services.
